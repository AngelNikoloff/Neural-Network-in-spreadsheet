# From Beginer for Beginers;

# Neural-Network-in-spreadsheet

Purpose:
It is for education purpose;
It allows playground with neural network;
You can see all network parameters how change during the training proces;

Simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with Backpropagation in Excel spreadsheet for solving XOR problem.

It is 3 neuron only.
It support momenetum also.

There are 2 variants - with tanh and with sigmoid activation fuctions;

p.s. I hope soon to make Recurent Neural Network (RNN) variant.( if somebody help, it will be nice)
