# From Beginer for Beginers;

# Neural-Network-in-spreadsheet for education and playground purpose;

Simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with Backpropagation in Excel spreadsheet with XOR example.
You can see all network parameters how change during the training proces;

It is 3 neuron only .
It support momenetum also.
There are 2 variants - with tanh and with sigmoid activation fuctions;
